# Densest subgraphs discovery
 
This is the code for experiments on the paper *Efficient and Effective Algorithms for Generalized Densest Subgraph Discovery*. Experiments on different kinds of graphs are performed on different cpp files. The file __experiment.cpp__ is for original density; __experiment2.cpp__ is for weighted density; __experiment3.cpp__ is for denominator weighted density. In each of the three mentioned file, functions __berkleyexp2__, __berkleyexp3__, __soda22exp2__, __soda22exp3__, __soda22exp4__ correspond to __cCoreExact__, __FlowExact__, __cCoreApp__, __cCoreApp*__, __FlowApp*__ and __FlowApp__ respectively.
 
## Getting Started
 
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
 
### Prerequisites
 
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
 
```
Give examples
```
 
### Installing
 
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running
 
Say what the step will be
 
```
Give the example
```
 
And repeat
 
```
until finished
```
 
End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
 
## Running the tests
 
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
 
### Break down into end to end tests
 
Explain what these tests test and why
 
```
Give an example
```
 
### And coding style tests
 
Explain what these tests test and why
 
```
Give an example
